# The GitHub Archive Program &amp; Arctic Code Vault

This repository is home to materials for the  [GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

At present we are opening the [Guide to the GitHub Code Vault](./GUIDE.md) to community input. This guide will be included at the beginning of each of the 200 hardened film reels we will use to archive every active public GitHub repository as of 2/2/2020. Please create a pull request for any specific proposed additions, deletions, or edits you may have for the guide. You can also open an issue if you have a more general idea, although we particularly encourage specific and concrete suggestions.
